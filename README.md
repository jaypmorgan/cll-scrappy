A simple python script to retrieve a list of command line 'lurves' that are mentioned
in the ubuntu podcast (http://ubuntupodcast.org).

## Usage
The script can be run using a python integreptor and a few command line arguments.
Those are as follows:

'''
python lurvescrappy.py all
'''

the '''all''' will say to the script that you wish to retrieve a comprehensive list
of commands mentioned through the podcast catalogue.

There are currently two arguments that are available for you to specify when running the script. Those
are:
- all (retrieve a complete list of commands)
- latest (retrieve the latest command mentioned)
